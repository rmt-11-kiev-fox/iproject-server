    "Product Name": "Philips 7443ALED Ultinon LED Bulb (Amber), 2 Pack",
    "Product Price": 21.09,
    "Product Url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077FVDF32",
    "Product Description": "Philips U+ltinon LED exterior signaling lights let you add performance and style to your ride. Upgrade your exterior lighting with a more intense red for stop lights, a more vibrant amber for turn signals, and brighter white light for backup and position lights. | Durable, long-lasting LED lighting You want bright, stylish lighting for your car but you donâ€™t want to keep replacing burned out bulbs. Philips Ultinon LED lights give you high-powered, automotive grade LEDs, with a lifetime up to 8 years. With conventional bulbs, the more powerful the light, the shorter its lifespan. Philips Ultinon LEDs deliver bright even light, yet have excellent resistance to heat and vibration. This makes them the perfect choice for a long-lasting performance. | View larger | View larger | View larger | Seeing a fast flash error? The Philips Ultinon CANbus Adapter can help Philips Ultinon LEDs use significantly less power than incandescent bulbs. Because of their energy-saving performance, Philips Ultinon LEDs can cause a dashboard error message or fast flash error. After installation of LED bulbs, some cars may go into â€˜limp homeâ€™ mode. The carâ€™s computer is looking for resistor value of the incandescent bulb, but the LED has a different resistor value than the incandescent bulb. The difference in resistor values can cause the car to go into â€˜limp homeâ€™ mode, and you could receive a message that the car has a problem. Thankfully this happens rarely and the issue can be resolved. First, verify that the limp mode is being caused by the LEDs by replacing them with the incandescent bulbs. If the â€˜limp homeâ€™ mode clears, it was most likely caused by the LED bulbs. This means that youâ€™ll want to install a Philips LED CANbus enabling adapter to provide the resistor value that the vehicle computer expects to see. Installation takes only minutes and requires only a pair of pliers. | Two type of CANbus adapters for exterior and interior applications We offer two types of CANbus enabling adapters for exterior and interior applications. The 5W CANbus is used for interior applications and license plate lighting. The 21W CANbus enabling adapter is used for exterior applications. | Reverse the polarity and flip the bulb if it doesnâ€™t light up Philips Ultinon LEDs are a direct replacement for conventional bulbs. Just follow the instructions on the package for easy installation. If your LED doesnâ€™t light up, itâ€™s likely that you need to â€œreverse the polarityâ€ by flipping the LED bulb. LEDs work like batteries with a positive and negative polarity. If the LED does not light up, simply remove the LED, flip the direction and reinstall. Since LED bulbs only draw current in one direction, the bulbs will not work unless inserted a certain way. So if the LEDs are inserted incorrectly, simply flip the LED and youâ€™re all set to see and be seen.",
